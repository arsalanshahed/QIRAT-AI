## üìä Understanding Your Results

### Pitch Analysis Feedback

#### What the Numbers Mean
- **Pitch off by X Hz at Y sec**: Your pitch was X Hz higher/lower than the reference at Y seconds
- **Positive numbers**: You sang/recited higher than the reference
- **Negative numbers**: You sang/recited lower than the reference

#### Feedback Examples
```
Pitch off by 65.2 Hz at 2.34 sec    # You were 65 Hz too high at 2.34 seconds
Pitch off by -78.1 Hz at 5.67 sec  # You were 78 Hz too low at 5.67 seconds
```

### Audio Quality Indicators

#### Good Quality Recording
- ‚úÖ Clear, consistent audio levels
- ‚úÖ Minimal background noise
- ‚úÖ Proper microphone positioning
- ‚úÖ Appropriate recording distance

#### Poor Quality Recording
- ‚ùå Muffled or distorted audio
- ‚ùå Excessive background noise
- ‚ùå Microphone too close or far
- ‚ùå Audio clipping or distortion
